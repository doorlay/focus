/*

We need to store in local browser storage which domains to block. We
also need to then actually block these domains. Just manipulate the DOM and say it's blocked?
"Blocked by Focus"

We're completely done with storing domains in the local storage via the blocklist.
Now we need to continually monitor which domain the user is going to and then block it
if it's on the blocklist and we're in the middle of a tomato.
